## Description:

Due Date
This test is to learn more about your skills and capabilities to implement algorithms and write production code. 
The problem: 
The program reads the currently reported problems (bugs) and calculates the due date following the rules below: 
●	Working hours are 9 AM to 5 PM every working day (Monday through Friday) 
●	The program does not deal with holidays, which means that a holiday on a Thursday is still considered a working day by the program. Also, a working Saturday will still be considered a non-working day by the system. 
●	The turnaround time is given in working hours, which means for example that 2 days are 16 hours. As an example: if a problem was reported at 2:12 PM on Tuesday then it is due by 2:12 PM on Thursday. 
●	A problem can only be reported during working hours, which means that all submit date values fall between 9 AM and 5 PM. 
●	Your task is to implement the CalculateDueDate method, which takes the submit date and turnaround time as an input and returns the date and time when the issue is to be resolved. 
●	You can use the standard date-time type or library. 
●	Additional features:
    ○	Make authentication with Firebase, login and logged in screens
    ○	Another list screen, where you can display the calculated values
